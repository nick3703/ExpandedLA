# ExtendedLA
R Code for Chapter 4

SimulationandFittingExtendedLA.R is the R code for simulating from the SPINGARCH(0,1) and fitting it using the extended Laplace Approximation technique.  The file also contains moment based estimates for initializing a Newton Raphson algorithm.


RCode_for_ExtendedLA_and_LA1.R is the R code to fit the Chicago violent crime data using extended LA and LA(1).
RCode_for_Stan_fit.R is the R code to fit the Chicago violent crime data using Stan relying on precomputing eigenvalues as outlined in Chapter 4.
